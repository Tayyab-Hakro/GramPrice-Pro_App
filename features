Run the app: When you open the HTML file in a browser, you can add tasks to the list. Each task has "Complete" and "Delete" buttons.
Complete button: Marks the task as completed.
Delete button: Removes the task from the list.
Two Features to Implement Yourself:
Feature 1: Add a "Priority Level" for Each Task

Add a dropdown or input box that allows the user to set a priority (e.g., Low, Medium, High) for each task when it's added.
Display the priority next to the task in the list.
You can also style the tasks differently based on their priority (e.g., red for high priority, green for low).
Feature 2: Add Task Filtering

Add a dropdown or buttons that allow users to filter tasks by status:
Show all tasks.
Show only completed tasks.
Show only incomplete tasks.
This will help the user easily view tasks based on their completion status.
